# Horiseon
*in this project i did my best attemp to clean up very messy code*

*my first step was to take a loot at the tags claases and id's*

*the classes for certain things were way to specific (added id's and made classes more broad)

*once the clean up of html i was able to remove a lot of duplicate css that was taking up way too much space*

*the site is now live and published via github"

*ENJOY*
